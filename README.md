 💰 Calculating Family Expenses using ServiceNow

 Overview

This project introduces an Automated Expense Management System designed to simplify and structure personal and household financial tracking using the ServiceNow platform. By leveraging ServiceNow's low-code environment, we eliminate the inaccuracies and manual effort associated with traditional expense tracking methods like spreadsheets or handwritten notes.

The system uses interlinked tables and real-time automation (Business Rules) to ensure that daily spending is accurately and instantly summarized into overall family expenses—promoting financial transparency and supporting informed financial decision-making within the family unit.
